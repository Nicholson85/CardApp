# Card App Coding Exercise

To run application `dotnet run`
To build application `dotnet build`
To run unit tests `dotnet test`

It is worth noting (in case you experience errors) that I built this using VSCode on a Mac due to current project limitations so I did not have the full Visual Studio IDE at my disposal.

If you run into any problems or have any questions, then just let me know.
